# All-basic-C-Programs & CPP Pattern Programming
I learned C programming by practicing a wide range of programs from beginner to advanced level. This includes logic building problems, pattern programs, arrays, strings, functions, recursion, pointers, structures, file handling, and mini projects.
It also covers a wide range of pattern printing programs covered in CPP.
